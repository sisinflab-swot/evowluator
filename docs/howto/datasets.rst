Datasets
========

Datasets must be placed in the `data` directory. Each dataset must have a root folder,
whose name is used by evOWLuator as the dataset name, and a subfolder for each supported syntax
(|syntaxes|), which in turn must contain ontologies serialized in the specified syntax.

The only requirement for datasets is to be available in at least one syntax; further syntaxes
can be generated by evOWLuator via the :ref:`convert<usage>` subcommand.
